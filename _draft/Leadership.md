# Developer Carrer Path Help

*In this article I am using the term Engineer that is working at hand in the job. You can replace it with any other job (that is not a Leadership job)

Let me begin with this: I think it is a common myth, that you as a engineer should step up the ladder to get into a Leadership position. 

## Status Quo: First Engineer, then Leader

This is how the career path in a lot of companies looks like

The problem with this path is, that a very good engineer is not a very good leader. Those are just two completely different jobs and it does not make sense to

- Let a engineer manage people without knowing how to do this
- Steal the time of one if your best engineers to do something else than develop

## Alternative ideas for careers in Engineering

Intern/Student Engineer -> Junior Engineer -> Engineer -> Senior Engineer -> ?

Now, that we know that the next step up of an engineer cannot be a Leadership position, we need to find alternative ways how to structure the company. Everyone wants to have a career path and therefore there has to be a way to give people credit without putting them into other Jobs.

There is not one pass for a senior engineer, there is a whole bunch of possible next steps. Despite the warning, it is absolutely possible to change into a leadership position. Maybe you are the type of leader and it is good for you, then of course go ahead, learn about leadership and choose that path.

But maybe you want to stay with technology because you love it and you are just really interested? Then you can be the Lead Engineer of a product or a Staff Engineer

You can always help the next generation so maybe your job is now to be a Multiplier and help the company to grow others. There are many ways this can be done. You can be a Engineer Advocate, an Expert Engineer or maybe you become a Solution Designer / Technical Product Manager. 


## Job titles

### Intern/Student/Apprentice

This is the super entry level. There is absolutely no knowledge upfront

### Junior Software Engineer, Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Expert Software Engineer

Those three titles are the heart of the engineering. Juniors are usually not very much experienced at the Job and may not have a degree at all.

Personally I don't give much credit to degrees, so I would put people with not experience in the Junior Engineer or Engineer role depending on their real knowledge and test outcomes.

If you have reached a certain quality in your work and are reliable then you are a Software Engineer. This is the role when you know what you do.

To reach a Senior Software Engineer level, you need to have proven that you always have a solution for a give problem, can execute this in a short amount off time. You can focus on the task and don't want to reinvent the wheel. You are calm in discussions and you can be trusted.

The term Expert Software Engineer seems to be made up to give someone different credit than the usual Senior Software engineer. Maybe the Expert is just really really good (an Expert) in a given field...

### Technical Product Manager / Solution Designer / Solution Architect

This is more product, than tech. It is very good if you don't really want to work at the heart (no actual coding etc.) but you have the general understanding of tech. Therefore you help the teams with writing the specs and documentation, help thinking through the problem, make your mind about the bigger picture and explain the situation to stakeholders.

### Lead Software Engineer / Lead Developer / Technical Lead

This is a senior engineer which is also the lead of one or more projects. The lead position is often happening naturally because one of the senior developers automatically gains it through experience and involvement. Most of the times, this is just the first developer that was there from the beginning. Due to that I find it very difficult to have a lead position as a job offering. It is more of an in-house career position.

### Staff Software Engineer/ Senior Staff Software Engineer

This kind of a Lead Software Engineer for a company group covering multiple projects and product lines. 

Senior Staff Software Engineer: This is a Staff Software Engineer plus Leadership task

### Principal Software Engineer
Oversight of multiple projects, Macro view on the Architecture, Technical Breakthrough
other: Technical Fellow, Chief Scientist, Architect

### Engineering Manager

### Engineering Director

### Chief Technical Officer (CTO)

The CTO is a mix of all other roles. The CTO title is used in small startups for the only one developer up to a management title which has no touch point with actual development at all.
