# Quality in Software Applications

* Definition

*Quality refers to whether a product works, and whether it fulfills the project stakeholders' needs.*

A simple sentence with great impact. Who is the stakeholder and what does "fulfil" actually mean?



* Agile and quality

The agile manifesto is all about ensuring quality - mostly in the sense to review the work more often to answer the question if the right thing is built and if it's working.


* Do the right thing and do the things right
