I don't remember exactly when I first heard about the Eisenhower Matrix but since then I've found it more and more useful to structure my (work) life. It really helps to prioritize what to do next if you have a lot of tasks.

Over the last couple years I have made my own version of the matrix, dedicated for to software development in SAAS applications. But first let me show you the original matrix.

## The Eisenhower Matrix (Original)

The original Eisenhower Matrix helps you to sort and prioritize tasks and is a method in Time Management. Let's see how it looks:

*Dwight D. Eisenhower: I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent*

As you can see, the matrix explains, that you should do the IMPORTANT AND URGENT things immediately and personally, then you work on the IMPORTANT BUT NOT URGENT ones and the others are more or less NOT IMPORTANT.

The matrix is a really good tool and I encourage you to use it. Now let's see at the special version for Software Developers.

## The Eisenhower Matrix (for Software Development)

The original matrix can be adapted to software development and SAAS applications like this:

Now the question it: Is it really good to always do the IMPORTANT AND URGENT things because the matrix says so? Do you really always want to work in the RED Zone?

Although the matrix advices you how to set your priorities this does not mean, that you should follow the Matrix blindly.

Of course it is NOT a good idea to always work in the URGENT/IMPORTANT quadrant. You can imagine, that always living in the DANGER-Zone leads to high stress levels and high stress levels cannot be maintained for a long period. Now here comes the thing. Software Development is a "Infinite Game" where the Players need to delivery straight and steady instead of a quick win.

So even if you have to go for IMPORTANT/URGENT issues first (Bugs etc.), you want to have a plan to stay out that quadrant and work in the IMPORTANT but NOT URGENT zone. You want to have time to think things through, plan them accordingly and executed them correctly. No rushing things.
