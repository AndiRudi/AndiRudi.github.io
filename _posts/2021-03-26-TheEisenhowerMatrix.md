# Important, but not urgent! The Eisenhower Matrix for Software Development!

I don't exactly know when I first heard about the Eisenhower Matrix but since then I've found it more and more useful to structure my (work) life. It really helps to prioritize what to do next if you have a lot of tasks.

## The Eisenhower Matrix (for Time Management)

Let's have a look at the original Eisenhower Matrix for Time Management.

*Dwight D. Eisenhower: I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent*

As you can see, the matrix explains, that you should do the IMPORTANT AND URGENT things immediately and personally, then you work on the IMPORTANT BUT NOT URGENT ones and the others are more or less NOT IMPORTANT.

## The Eisenhower Matrix (for Software Development)

The above matrix can easily be adapted to software development.

Now the question is, is it really good to always do the IMPORTANT AND URGENT things? Do you always want to work in the RED Zone?

Although the matrix explains how you should set your priorities in a given set of tasks, this does not mean, that you should follow the Matrix blindly.

Of course it is not a good idea to always live in the URGENT/IMPORTANT quadrant,because it is the area where the Stress Level is very high. A high stress level cannot be maintained for a long period ... and Software Development is one of those Infinite Games where the Players need to delivery straight and steady.

So even if you have to go for IMPORTANT/URGENT issues first, you want to work on a plan to get out of that quadrant and stay in the IMPORTANT but NOT URGENT zone.
