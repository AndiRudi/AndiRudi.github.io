# Andreas Rudischhauser

When I was about 4 years old, my father bought a Schneider CPC 464 computer. I think he didn't expect that a year later I will have completed my first program. Of course, I couldn't actually write at that age, I barely could read. But I could type the code from the manual into the computer letter by letter. When I first hit `Run` and brought the program to life, I immediately fell in love.

40 years later - and a lot of written code - I am still that child and I love it, when the program runs. I learned a lot along the way from different languages (Basic, Logo, QBasic, Visual Basic, Pascal, C/C++, C#, X++, Python, Java, Javascript, Ruby and HTML/CSS) over different application styles (WinForms Desktop Applications, ASP Websites, Big monolithic Dynamics AX ERP System, small .net core docker based micro services) with a hell lot of (anti)patterns and practices. Yet each new development brings new findings and I've come to realize, that there is always something to learn. And I like it.

As I'm getting older it's getting harder to remember things, so I started to write this blog to help me remember and share the things I've learned.
